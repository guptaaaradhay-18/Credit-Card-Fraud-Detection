# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. It leverages a dataset of credit card transactions, applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and various classification algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent activities.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training and evaluation (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.)
- Performance metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC)
- Visualization of results

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the Jupyter notebook `crdit card fraud detection.ipynb`.
3. Follow the notebook cells to run the analysis and model training.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage
- Run the notebook step by step to explore the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.
- Modify or extend the notebook to try different algorithms or tune hyperparameters.

## Dataset
The dataset used contains anonymized credit card transactions, with features representing transaction details and a target variable indicating fraud status.

## Results
The notebook provides visualizations and metrics to compare model performance and highlight the most effective approach for fraud detection.
